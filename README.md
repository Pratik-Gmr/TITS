## About the project:

Tits is a free and open-source **Version Control System**. This project aims to create a 
**mini-git like software** which is able to save/commit snapshot of a project, check different versions/commits,
revert back to one of the versions within the commit history, create branches and merge.
Our VCS aims to offer fundamental features such as **commit, check, revert, branch, merge**.
The project is designed to be user-friendly while also catering to the needs of users who require efficiency and flexibility in version-control.
Our goal is to leverage the power and efficiency of C++ and concepts of OOP to build a robust and
user friendly VCS that can serve as a valuable tool for all developers/project managers.
