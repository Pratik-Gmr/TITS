## About the project:
We developed an **Version Control System**. This project aims to create a **mini-git like software** which is able to save commit/sbapshot of a project, check different versions/commits, and revert back to one of the versions within the commit history.
 
Our VCS aims to offer fundamental features such as **commit, checkout, revert**. The project is designed to be user-friendly while also catering to the needs of users who require efficiency and flexibility in version-control.
 
Our goal is to leverage the power and efficiency of C++ and concepts of OOP to build a robust and user friendly VCS that can serve as a valuable tool for all developers/project managers.
